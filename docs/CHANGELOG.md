## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-15

### ðŸ”’ Security

- **CRITICAL:** Hardcoded minimum event requirement to 500 with triple integrity checks
  - Added three independent validation constants (`REQUIRED_MIN_EVENTS`, `_VERIFY_A`, `_VERIFY_B`, `_VERIFY_C`)
  - Integrity checks in constructor, `hasMinimumEntropy()`, and `generateSeed()`
  - Prevents runtime tampering with security requirements
- Implemented dual-path XOR fortification architecture
  - Path A: User behavioral entropy (primary trust anchor)
  - Path B: CSPRNG whitening via `crypto.getRandomValues()`
  - XOR mixing provides >256-bit security margin
- Enhanced final mixing with double-hash (SHA-512 â†’ SHA-512)
- Designed for scenarios where CSPRNG may be compromised/backdoored

### Added

- New `getProgress()` method for real-time UX feedback
  - Returns current/required events, percentage, and ready status
  - Enables progress bars and user interaction guidance
- Weighted event counting system
  - Keyboard events: weight 3 (~8-10 bits entropy)
  - Mouse down, touch start, device motion: weight 2 (~4-6 bits)
  - Mouse move, touch move, scroll: weight 1 (~2-4 bits)
  - Total 500 weighted events â‰ˆ 150-200 bits effective entropy
- Asynchronous hash batching (100 iterations/batch)
  - Non-blocking UI during 5000 iterations
  - `setTimeout(0)` yields between batches
  - Maintains responsiveness in real-time applications

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Removed `options.minEvents` configuration parameter
  - Now hardcoded to 500 for security
  - Attempts to override trigger console warning
  - No exceptions, no test mode bypass
- **BREAKING:** `getStats().totalEvents` now returns weighted sum instead of raw count
- **BREAKING:** Seed generation is now non-deterministic
  - Path B introduces fresh randomness on every call
  - Same user entropy produces different seeds
  - Improves security but breaks reproducibility
- **BREAKING:** Export name changed from `window.ntrpRng` to `window.ntrpRNG` (uppercase RNG)
- Updated all event handlers to use weighted increments
- Enhanced `generateSeed()` with dual-path architecture
- Modified `hasMinimumEntropy()` to check weighted event count â‰¥ 500

### Performance

- Generation time increased by ~100-200ms due to async batching
- UI remains responsive during 5000-iteration hashing
- Suitable for real-time web applications

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive security considerations section
- Updated threat model documentation
- Added migration guide for v1.2.1 â†’ v1.3.0
- New API documentation for `getProgress()` method

### Migration Notes

1. Remove `minEvents` from constructor options (now ignored)
2. Update `window.ntrpRng` references to `window.ntrpRNG`
3. Update event threshold checks to account for weighted counting
4. Remove assumptions about deterministic/reproducible seeds
5. Account for +100-200ms generation overhead in tight loops
